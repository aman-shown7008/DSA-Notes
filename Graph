Q. What is Graph?
A. A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.
For ex- On facebook, everything is a node. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...anything that has data is a node.

Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship.

Graphs can be categorized into two main types:

1. Directed Graph (Digraph): In a directed graph, edges have a direction associated with them, indicating a one-way relationship between nodes.
   Ex - 
   A --> B
   |     |
   v     v
   C --> D
   Nodes: A, B, C, D
   Directed Edges:
    A points to B
    A points to C
    C points to D
    B points to D

2. Undirected Graph: In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship between nodes.
   Ex-
   A --- B
   |     |
   |     |
   C --- D
   Nodes: A, B, C, D
   Undirected Edges:
    A is connected to B
    A is connected to C
    B is connected to D
    C is connected to D

Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. Vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.
Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.
Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.
